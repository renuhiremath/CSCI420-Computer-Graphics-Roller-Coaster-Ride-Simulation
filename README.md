# CSCI420-Computer-Graphics-Roller-Coaster-Ride-Simulation
Problem Statement: http://run.usc.edu/cs420-s18/assignments/assign2/assign2.html

In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Features:
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 

2. Completed all Levels

3. Used Catmull-Rom Splines to render the Track

4. Rendered a Rail Cross Section 

5. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation

6. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) 

7. Render a Double Rail 

8. Added wooden Cross Bars
